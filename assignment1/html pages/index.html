    <p>Odds are, you're at least slightly familiar with raccoons. If not, today is your lucky day. Raccoons have always been one of the most misunderstood mammals. These nocturnal guys aren't <i>all</i> rabies and midnight trashcan runs- they also enjoy raquetball and long walks on the beach. So next time you're about to shoo one of these guys away from eating the moldy pizza from under your porch, think again; invite him in for a drink, maybe even a round of Uno. You might just be surpised by the outcome and the lifelong frienship sure to bloom. </p>
